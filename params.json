  "body": "#CARTA\r\n\r\nCARTA is the Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy, a new visualization tool for designed for [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org), the [VLA](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/), and the radio telescopes of the future such as the [SKA](http://skatelescope.org/).\r\n\r\nCARTA provides three different ways of using the program.  Most users will use the _Desktop_ version of CARTA, which operates as a stand-alone application.  Archives can install the _Server_ version of CARTA that allows users to visualize data within the archive without downloading it.  Finally, CARTA provides a _Scripted_ interface that allows the application to be controlled from Python.\r\n\r\n### Why another viewer?\r\n\r\nWhile there are many choices of visualization tools suitable for radio astronomy data, CARTA provides a new look at the problem by combining the rich feature set of the current CASA image viewer with the remote visualization viewer developed as part of the [CyberSKA](http://www.cyberska.org/) project.  Remote visualization provides an opportunity to visualize large data sets in the archives of their host telescopes.  By dedicating some computing resources to visualization within archives, users can explore data without downloading it.  CARTA will be integrated into the ALMA and NRAO archives.  \r\n\r\n### Try CARTA Desktop beta version 0.6.0\r\nCARTA is supported for:\r\n\r\n*  Mac OS X 10.10 and 10.11: [Download dmg](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6trezaEcQQ9cDdlTlBtN3RqRmc)\r\n*  Ubuntu 14.04 and later: [Download tgz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6trezaEcQQ9U2JFbk5CWGlQalE)\r\n*  CentOS / RHEL 6 and later: [Download tgz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6trezaEcQQ9STh2UjYwYXo4VTA)\r\n\r\nCARTA beta installs carry test data and are large (600 MB).  \r\n\r\n_Linux Installation Instructions_: The tgz file will expand into a directory tree structure.  To run CARTA, execute the shell script `carta_0.6.0/carta.sh`.  \r\n\r\n_Side Effects_: The beta version of CARTA creates a directory `$HOME/CARTA/` which hosts test image data and files needed to run the program.\r\n\r\n_Got Issues?_: [File an issue](https://github.com/AstroUA/CARTAvis/issues) on our repository or contact Erik Rosolowsky ([@low-sky](https://github.com/low-sky/)).\r\n\r\n### Contribute to CARTA\r\nCARTA is built on a plugin model and we welcome contributions that expand CARTA's capabilities.  We are developing our project on [github](https://github.com/Astroua/CARTAvis) and have developer documentation available [here](http://carta-viewer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). \r\n\r\n### The CARTA Team\r\nThe lead investigators are [Erik Rosolowsky](https://www.ualberta.ca/~erosolow/) (U. Alberta), Jeff Kern (NRAO),  [Gregory Sivakoff](https://www.ualberta.ca/~sivakoff/) (U. Alberta), and Russ Taylor (U. Cape Town, U. Western Cape, IDIA).\r\n\r\nWe are grateful for the support of several sponsoring organizations: CARTA is developed through the ALMA Development Program administered by [NRAO](http://www.nrao.edu/) with key contributions from [CANARIE](http://www.canarie.ca/).  Remote visualization relies on the PureWeb technology developed by [Calgary Scientific](http://www.calgaryscientific.com/).  \r\n\r\n",
