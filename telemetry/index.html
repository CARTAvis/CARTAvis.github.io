<h1>Data collection in CARTA</h1>
<h3>December 13, 2021</h3>
<p>CARTA can collect anonymous usage data, in order to help the development team prioritize additional features and
    platforms. No personal or scientific information will be collected.</p>
<p>Data collection is an opt-in feature, and can be disabled at any time. Furthermore, the CARTA team will remove any
    telemetry data for a particular user if they so require, upon receipt of an email containing their anonymous user ID
    (visible from the preferences dialog in CARTA) sent to the <a href="mailto:support@carta.freshdesk.com">helpdesk</a>.
</p>
<p>The following information is currently collected after users opt into the telemetry feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Geographic region (country / province) of user, for estimating which scientific projects make use of CARTA.</li>
    <li>One-way hash of the IP address (with no ability to recover the original IP address), for blacklisting and
        preventing spurious telemetry entries.
    </li>
    <li>Session information: Current CARTA backend and browser platform identifier (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04, MacOS 11.0), for
        tracking user platforms.
    </li>
    <li>Session duration and dimensions of opened files, for tracking how CARTA is used and to better tailor our
        development efforts.
    </li>
</ul>
